# E-commerce sneaker site!

This was my first E-commerce site I 
have ever built it was super challenging
but mostly fun. This project uses Next.js, React
and Sanity a headless CMS.

## Why did I use these technologies?
### Next.js
I used Next.js for my project because it provided several key features that greatly improved the development experience and the user experience of the final product.

One of the main advantages of using Next.js is server-side rendering (SSR). With SSR, the initial HTML of a page is generated on the server and sent to the client, resulting in faster load times and better search engine optimization (SEO). Additionally, it allows showing the user whatever item was clicked without any delay, this makes the application more responsive.

Another important feature of Next.js is its file system routing. It allows you to easily define routes based on the file structure of your application. This makes it easy to organize and maintain your code, as well as providing an intuitive experience for developers.

Next.js also provides automatic code splitting, which ensures that only the necessary code is loaded on a given page, resulting in faster load times.

Overall, Next.js made developing my project much easier and resulted in a better user experience. It allowed me to take advantage of the latest JavaScript features and the rich ecosystem of React libraries and tools. It also provided a development server and hot module replacement, which made development process more efficient.

### React.js
I used React for my project because it is a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

One of the main advantages of using React is its component-based architecture. By breaking down a complex UI into smaller, reusable components, it makes it easy to manage and reason about the state of the application. Additionally, it allows for efficient updates and renders of the component tree, resulting in smooth and fast user experiences.

React also provides a virtual DOM, which optimizes updates and improves the performance of the application. It only updates the parts of the DOM that have actually changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page.


### Sanity (Headless cms)
I used Sanity for my project because it is a powerful and flexible headless content management system (CMS).

One of the main advantages of using Sanity is its real-time collaboration capabilities. Sanity's architecture allows multiple users to make changes to the content simultaneously, which greatly improves the team's productivity and workflow.

Another key feature of Sanity is its flexibility in terms of data modeling. Sanity enables you to define custom data structures and schemas through a simple and intuitive interface. This allows you to match your data model to your specific project needs, which helps in providing a better user experience.
